        If shedding pounds and ounces is your primary concern, then titanium is
        probably your material of choice. It’s a bit more expensive than other
        options, but it’s incredibly light and durable. Titanium’s main
        drawbacks are balanced out by its uses. For example, its heat-dispersal
        is efficient but not even, so it can boil water quickly but isn’t great
        for much else. That’s ideal when you’re doing a thru-hike, where weight
        is more critical than a fresh-cooked meal every day. On the other end is
        the supremely heavy cast iron. A cast-iron pan or dutch oven is too
        heavy to take on a long trek, but if you bring it car camping, it has
        more uses than any other single pan. However, you won’t find any cast
        iron camping cookware kits, so you may want to get a separate pan to
        complement one of the kits we recommend here.​ Most of the best camping
        cookware we recommend here is made of titanium or another similar light
        metal, such as aluminum. In fact, hard-anodized aluminum is one of the
        best all-around materials for cooking. It’s lightweight, durable, heats
        evenly, and can even be nonstick.​ If you alternate between backpacking
        and car camping or want to be ready for anything, hard-anodized aluminum
        is one of the best options you can choose. Once you’ve picked out your
        favorite set of cookware, you’ve got to know how to use it. Don’t worry
        — it’s not all about campfires! One of the best ways to cook, whether
        you’re in the backcountry or at a campsite, is using a camp stove. Most
        often, camp stoves run off of gas or liquid fuel to give you a steady
        and reliable flame. The type of camp stove you use will, as always,
        depend on your needs. Some are larger and more powerful. They use
        canisters with a large enough volume to cook meals for many campers.
        Others are just enough to cook a meal for one or two, and others still
        do use wood.
